This is the Python part of Asap version 3.x.

MAIN SUBDIRECTORIES:

analysis: 
    Modules for analysing simulations.

Internal:
    Modules internal to Asap - do not load in scripts unless
    you know what you are doing.

io:
    I/O modules overriding the ones provided in ASE.  Mainly
    Trajectory stuff supporting parallel simulations.

md:
    Molecular Dynamics modules overriding the ones from ASE.

optimize:
    Energy minimization modules override the ones from ASE.

MonteCarlo:
    General framework for doing Monte Carlo simulations.

Setup:
    Modules for setting up special structures.  Could have been
    part of ASE instead.

NanoparticleMC:
    Modules for two-level Monte Carlo simulations of nanoparticles.
    This is more part of a research project than generally useful.

Tools:
    Deprecated.

Utilities:
    Deprecated.

Filters:
    Deprecated.
