This Tools directory under the ASAP project contains small Python
programs, intended to be run from the command line to serve purposes
not central to the functioning of Asap.  This includes setup scripts,
file conversion, etc.

Most scripts are written in such a way that they could be imported
into another python script, if necessary, but that is not the main way
to use them (and may be untested).

AsapFileToTrajectory.py oldfile newfile [frame1 [frame2]]

    Converts an Asap version 1.x netcdf file to an ASE version 2
    trajectory file.  If a single frame number is given, only that
    frame is converted.  If two frame numbers are given, all frame
    from the first to the last are converted (-1 means the last
    frame).  If no frame numbers are given, all frames are converted.
