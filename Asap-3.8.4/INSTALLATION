Asap version 2 and 3
====================

Asap exists in two main versions, version 2.X and 3.X.  This document
is common for installing them both.  **The two versions can be installed
simultaneously without interfering with each other!**

Download Asap
=============

* The latest version of Asap-2 is version 2.20.0 (released 11. July 2008).

  It is available as a compressed tar file: Asap-2.20.0.tar.gz_


* The latest version of Asap-3 is version 3.0.2 (released 15. October 2008).

  It is available as a compressed tar file: Asap-3.0.2.tar.gz_

.. _Asap-3.0.2.tar.gz: http://dcwww.camp.dtu.dk/campos/download/Asap-3.0.2.tar.gz

It is also possible to get Asap from the our SVN_ server.

Quick installing guide
======================

1. If you have not already done so, you should install the version of
   the Atomic Simulation Environment relevant for the desired version of Asap:

   For Asap version 2.X, `install the Campos Atomic Simulation
   Environment version 2.X.`__

   For Asap version 3.X, `install the Atomic Simulation Environment
   version 3.X.`__

2. Unpack the tarball and go to the Asap-x.y directory::

     tar xvfz Asap-x.y.tar.gz
     cd Asap-x.y

3. Install with the standard command for installing Python packages::

     python setup.py install

   (this must be done as root).  

These instructions install the serial version of Asap, compiled with
the same compiler as was used to compile Python (most likely gcc).

Special installation instructions
=================================

Installation using the Intel compiler and/or installation on clusters
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to install the parallel version, or if you want to compile
Asap with the Intel or PathScale C++ compiler (for better performance), you can
install Asap using GNU make.  The Intel and PathScale compilers are
automatically detected and used if available.

To install the serial version::

  make depend
  make serial
  make install

To install both the serial and parallel version (not yet available in
Asap 3.X)::

  make depend
  make all
  make install-parallel

For more information, please read the `ASAP detailed installation
instructions`_.

In-place installation for SVN users
-----------------------------------

If you got Asap from SVN_ and always want to use the newest version,
you probably want to compile it in-place.  This can be done with::

  make depend
  make serial

if you only want the serial version, or::

  make depend
  make all

if you also need the parallel version.  After updating from SVN_, you
only need to re-run ``make depend`` if ``make serial`` (or ``make
all``) fails with an instruction to do so.

To use Asap compiled in this way, you need to put it on your PYTHON
path.  Assuming that Asap is placed in $HOME/Asap, PYTHONPATH should
be set to::

  $HOME/Asap/Python:$HOME/Asap/Swig/XXX  (for Asap version 2.X)

or::

  $HOME/Asap/Python:$HOME/Swig/XXX  (for Asap version 2.X)

where XXX is the output of the command ``uname -m``.


Instructions for special Linux distributions
--------------------------------------------

RPM-based distributions
  No RPM's are provided, since they are more likely to go wrong than
  the simple distutils-based installation described above.

Gentoo Linux
  Hopelessly outdated ebuilds are available from `our Gentoo Linux
  guide <wiki:ASE:Installing_CAMPOS_software_on_Gentoo_Linux>`_.

Mac OS X
--------

Asap can be installed on a Mac running OS X, but for Asap version 2
you cannot use the default compiler (`bug 144`_).  You first have to
change to gcc version 3.3::

  sudo gcc_select 3.3
  sudo python setup.py install
  sudo gcc_select 4.0

**Hint:** If you forgot to change the compiler, remember to erase the
``build`` subdirectory before trying again.  Otherwise Asap will not
be recompiled correctly.

Note that we do not use Macs, so these instructions may be outdated.

Installation on the DTU gbar machines
-------------------------------------

Getting Asap to work on the DTU gbar machines is tricky, read
`Installing Asap on the DTU databar`_.

Asap is used together with VASE (Visual ASE) for teaching purposes
(mainly course 10030 Physics and Nanotechnology).  Instructions for
installing that combination in the DTU Databar can be found here:
`Installing VASE and Asap in the DTU databar`_.
