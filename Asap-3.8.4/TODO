* Investigate why -DTIMING apparently can cause spurious core dumps.

* Verify NPTdynamics with respect to conservation of the Gibbs Energy.
  It is not the 1/3 factor missing in the pV term, as pV is zero in
  the test case.

  A number of bugs were found in the calculation of the Gibbs energy.
  Currently, the non-conservation is not very large, but I am unsure
  if it is a problem.

* The center of mass may gain a momentum in Langevin dynamics.  Prevent it!

* Make test suite and better examples.
