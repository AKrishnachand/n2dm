This directory contains the beginning of a test suite.  

The following tests can be performed.  The output should be
self-explanatory, ending with the statement "all tests successful" or
the like.

* test_reproducible.py

    Checks that the energies, forces and stresses have not changed
    since version 1.4 of 08.11.2002.

* testtools.py

    A module for implementing the test suite.  Tests itself when run
    on the command line.  This is the only test where tests are expected_
    to fail.

* testStress.py

    Test energy and stress calculations within the EMT.  Cu and Ag are tested.

* testVerlet.py

    Test verlet dynamics and that the EMT potential is 100%
    reproducible.  The file testVerlet.pickle contains the expected
    final configuration and final forces + stresses.  Even the
    smallest change to the forces returned by EMT will break this test.

* testTrajectory.py

    Tests trajectories by running the same test as testVerlet, storing
    configurations in a trajectory, before reading and checking the
    last configuration.

* testException.py

    Tests that exceptions are correctly propagated from C++ to Python.

* Langevin.py

    Tests Langevin dynamics.  Very slow.

* testNPT.py

    Tests NPT dynamics.  Very slow.

* testSubset.py

    Tests the subset filter.
